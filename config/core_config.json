	// external_bins list a list of external commands you want SexyMF to be
	// able to exectute. So, if you don't want anyone to be able to call
	// svccfg through the API, take it out of here. Some objects contain an
	// array of flags. Only those flags can be used. Some commands have
	// subcommands, which are another command-like object nested inside the
	// higher-level one.
